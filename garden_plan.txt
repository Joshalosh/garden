- Bugs
 - if there is literally no more squares for a powerup to appear in when an enemy slay happens 
   the game crashes. (I think I fixed this to work with a single space but perhaps I didn't make 
   this work for the instance there are literally no spaces available).
 - Make sure to unload all the assets and sounds and stuff. I need to pay attention to the 
   de-initialisation phase.
