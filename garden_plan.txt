- Refactor
 - Fix get tile rect function to not do multiple things.
 - Go over all the TODOS.

- Bugs
 - if there is literally no more squares for a powerup to appear in when an enemy slay happens 
   the game crashes. (I think I fixed this to work with a single space but perhaps I didn't make 
   this work for the instance there are literally no spaces available).
 - Make sure to unload all the assets and sounds and stuff. I need to pay attention to the 
   de-initialisation phase.
 - The game bugs out when going up into the top wall because i've gotten rid of the wall up there,
   to make space for the GUI bar. The solution is probably to just make it so that if the player target 
   position also goes into a tile_type of none its a game over as well.
